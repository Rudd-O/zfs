BUILDING A PROPER GRUB RPM

You can rpmbuild a set of GRUB2 RPMs by using the two files in this folder:

1. rpm -ivh the src.rpm of grub2 downloaded from Koji
2. apply the patch file grub.spec.diff in the SPECS directory of your
   RPM build %_topdir
3. copy file 0486-Ensure-proper-boot-configuration-in-the-case-of-Linu.patch
   to the SOURCES directory of your RPM build %_topdir
4. rpmbuild -bs (or -ba) path/to/patched/grub2.spec

This is the recommended way of building a GRUB2 set of RPMs with ZFS boot
support.
