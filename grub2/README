Modern Fedora 19+ GRUB just needs to be rebuilt with libzfs present.

To ensure a proper build, apply the grub.spec.diff file in this directory
to the specfile of the upstream SRPM.  This will make the build fail
unless zfs-devel is installed, which is what you want.

This is still not enough to get the SRPM to work properly however. The
10_linux file that gets installed in /etc/grub.d has a bug.  To fix that
bug, you can apply the 10_linux.diff patch in this directory to that file.
It would be a great idea if this patch could be incorporated into the spec
file and properly applied when you build.

The grub_mkconfig_zfs_support.diff file is now obsolete in modern distros.

BUILDING A PROPER GRUB RPM

You can rpmbuild a set of GRUB2 RPMs by using the two files in the rpmbuild
subdirectory:

1. rpm -ivh the src.rpm of grub2 downloaded from Koji
2. apply the patch file grub.spec.diff in the SPECS directory of your
   RPM build %_topdir
3. copy file 0485-Ensure-proper-boot-configuration-in-the-case-of-Linu.patch
   to the SOURCES directory of your RPM build %_topdir
4. rpmbuild -bs (or -ba) path/to/patched/grub2.spec

This is the recommended way of building a GRUB2 set of RPMs with ZFS boot
support.
